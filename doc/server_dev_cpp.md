C++ Server Development Guide
============================

The C++ server has so many dependencies that
a dockerized building environment is needed.

After docker is properly installed, download
the file [html_static.o.bz2](http://aaalgo.com/picpac/server/html_static.o.bz2)
to the picpac directory and type the following:

```
./make-server.sh
```
